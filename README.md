I run [**Productora**](https://www.productora.co/), a one-person product analytics studio powered by AI agents.

I specialize in structuring ambiguous ideas into measurable frameworks not just analyzing data, but designing the questions that drive clarity.

* Turn business problems into data questions  
* Build structured analytical processes around abstract ideas  
* Discover insights through statistical modeling and behavioral analysis  
* Deliver clarity, not just dashboards

### üõ†Ô∏è Vibe Engineering

 I practice what's often called [vibe engineering](https://www.productora.co/blog/vibe-coding-to-engineering); building fast, delightful systems that feel as good as they function. My current tools of choice are Next.js, Supabase, and Vercel, and I'm heads-down crafting Second Brain, an AI-native knowledge app. Also a Bun enjoyer.
